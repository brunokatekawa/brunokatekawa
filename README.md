Hello, I'm **Bruno Katekawa**. I've worked for companies of various sizes, from startups to multinationals where I had extensive experience in **Information Technology and User Experience**, extracting the maximum potential from these disciplines in order to deliver the greatest possible value to the businesses and their customers.

In addition, I’ve collaborated with projects that positively impacted **hundreds of thousands** of people that use banking services (retail, corporate and private), telecoms services and health insurance services.

I appreciate collaborating with projects that change the way businesses and industries operate to make positive impact to people.

I learned a lot and **I’m still learning** with every project that I collaborate and every people that I know.

Got a wicked problem? Let's solve it together!

<br>

_A **Wicked Problem** is a problem that is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize. It refers to an idea or problem that cannot be fixed, where there is no single solution to the problem; - Wikipedia_
